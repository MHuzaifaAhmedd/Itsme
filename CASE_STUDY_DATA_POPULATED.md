## What This Means

### Before
Every section showed:
```
[AWAITING: Feature #1 Name]
[AWAITING: What it does]
[AWAITING: Why it matters]
```

### After
Real data like:
```
Multi-Role Authentication System

What it does:
JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies, CSRF protection, 
IP geofencing (hard/soft modes), device management, and role-based 
authorization for 4 user roles...

Why it matters:
Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive HR data, ensures employees 
access from approved locations only, protects against XSS and CSRF 
attacks...

How implemented:
JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies with 30-day expiry for employees...
```
